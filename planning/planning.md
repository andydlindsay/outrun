# Thoughts

* A user avatar will spawn on the gameboard
* One or more monsters will spawn on the gameboard
* Monsters will move towards the user avatar over time
* Starting gameboard layout will be preconfigured
* Starting gameboard will be 31 x 30
* Gameboard level can be input as a string (w = wall, f = floor, n = nothing)
